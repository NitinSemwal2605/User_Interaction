# Citizen Engagement Platform


The Citizen Engagement Platform is a web application designed to promote digital inclusion and citizen participation in urban management. The platform allows citizens to report local issues (such as broken streetlights, potholes, illegal dumping, etc.) and track the government's response to these issues in real-time. The platform fosters transparency and accountability in government-citizen interactions and helps governments manage and resolve urban problems efficiently.
